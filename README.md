# pandas 🐼

A personal experimentation project to explore Python and Pandas — building intuition, testing workflows, and mastering data manipulation one DataFrame at a time.

## 📌 Project Overview

`pandas` is a sandbox repository for learning and experimenting with:

- **Pandas** (DataFrames, Series, grouping, merging, time series)
- **Python** (list comprehensions, lambda functions, decorators, context managers)
- **Data cleaning & visualization** (with Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- **Best practices** in data analysis pipelines

No grand goals here — just curiosity-driven code, failed attempts, and "aha!" moments documented for future me (and anyone who finds it useful).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploration)
- pytest (for light testing)

_Made with ❤️ for learning. No pandas were harmed in the making of this project._
